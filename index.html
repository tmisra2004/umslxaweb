Thank you for your interest in Chi Alpha at the University of Missouri-St. Louis! We are a movement of college-age men and women earnestly following Jesus.
<br />
Our mission is to reconcile students to Christ, equipping them through spirit-filled communities of prayer, worship, fellowship, discipleship, and mission to transform the university, the marketplace and the world.
<br />
Although we are a Christian group, many of our friends are not Christians and come from various parts of the world, including the U.S.A! 
<br />
We welcome people from all different backgrounds and faiths to participate in our activities. 
<br />
Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship has Greek letters in its name, but we are not a fraternity, we are a family!
